DESCRIPTION

       -d     align declaration specifications that are grouped together

       -dd    like -d but consider empty lines as part of a declaration group

       -i indent
              the initial indentation in spaces.  If omitted seven spaces will
              be used unless the first line in the input starts with **FREE or
              if -I is used.
              This option overrides -u

       -I     support IceBreak extensions, see ICEBREAK below

       -p     count  parenthesis  and indent with one shiftwidth for each open
              parenthesis

       -pp    like -p but if the line is broken after the first argument to  a
              procedure, then the next line is aligned with the first argument

       -r     preserve  the  relative  indentation between multi line strings.
              If the first line is indented four and the second six, then sec-
              ond will end up being indented two spaces more

       -s width
              the size in spaces for a indent

       -u     use  the  indentaion from the first input line, useful when used
              on part of a file, eg. as the equalprg in vim
              This option overrides -i

       -h     show help and exit

       -v     display version information

ICEBREAK
       When rpglefmt is compiled with FEAT_ICEBREAK,  then  the  command  line
       option  -I  can  be  used  which  enabled specific handling of IceBreak
       extensions.

       Supported extensions are:

       o      C-style multi line comments

       o      IceBreak expression strings
